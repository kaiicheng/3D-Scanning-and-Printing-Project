# 3D-Scanning-and-Printing-Project

This project is built for the practice of 3D scanning and printing.

I use following softwares and tools...

Editing softwares: Autodesk Fusion 360, Unity, Blender.

3D scanning tools: Structure SDK (iOS), Scaniverse.

3D printing tools: UltiMaker Cura, Pursa.


## Descriptions 

- Constructed a deep learning system using Python, including auto-differentiation, backpropagation, and tensor matrix operations.

- Implemented parallel computing with Numba and CUDA.

- Visualized with Streamlit and tested functions using pytest and Flake8.

## Overview

This module requires `fast_ops.py`, `cuda_ops.py`, `scalar.py`, `tensor_functions.py`, `tensor_data.py`, `tensor_ops.py`, `operators.py`, `module.py`, and `autodiff.py` from Module 3.


Additionally you will need to install and download the MNist library.

(On Mac, this may require installing the `wget` command)

```
pip install python-mnist
mnist_get_data.sh
```


This assignment requires the following files from the previous assignments. You can get these by running

```bash
python sync_previous_module.py previous-module-dir current-module-dir
```
